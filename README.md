Proof of history enables the blockchain to work fast while maintaining security and decentralization. <br>Here's an analogy:

If snapshots of dye diffusion where scrambled you would know how to place resulting images in order again because of the loss of entropy as a function of time.

Proof of history uses a verifiable delay function to hash incoming events and transactions.

Every event has a unique hash and count along this data structure as a function of real-time.

This information tells us what event had to come before another almost like a cryptographic timestamp giving us a verfiable ordering of events as a function of time.
