Proof of history enables the blockchain to work fast while maintaining security and decentralization. <br>Here's an analogy:

If snapshots of dye diffusion where scrambled

you would know how to place resulting images in order again because of the loss of entropy as a function of time.

Proof of history uses a verifiable delay function to hash incoming events and transactions.

Every event has a unique hash and count along this data structure as a function of real-time.

This information tells us what event had to come before another almost like a cryptographic timestamp giving us a verfiable ordering of events as a function of time.

Each node gets a cryptographic clock that helps the network agree on time and ordering of events without having to wait to hear from other nodes.

Unlike slower, traditional blockchains often times throttled by various consensus mechanisms, Solana achieves high-throughput without sacrificing network security.
